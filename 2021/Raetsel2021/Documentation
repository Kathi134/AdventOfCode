01: stood up too late, but solved it quick
02: ez, first one to finish
03: not too easy but still
04: oxygen who dis
05: still really solveable
06: first time confronted with runtime question 
07: quite basic - not too fast/slow easy/hard cool/ugly
08: pretty cool to find system that finds pattern
09: depth search on part 2 was pretty hard to remember (looked up in school stuff)
10: needed hint of using stack but then things went out easily
11: not too easy but went out
12: did bruuute and whiped out wrongs (solved after asking christoph & 3 days)
13: loved the origami task, was pretty fast
14: acdc polymers washed my brain but so proud I got it (after 3 days)
15: implemented dijkstra for the first time (all totally on my own - so proud)
17: trick shot boosted by turkeyDev but actually solved on my own
18: pretty cool string-replacement-graphical solution
25: sweet easy final task - but p2 not available with stars missing //1n

16: much help from turkeyDev, especially fancy cursor //2h
20: solved after hint of flashing background and with foreign java code //2h
21: did first part real quick, 2nd with help of a python code //1o 1h
24: quite cool assembler task, but hard to solve - took small hint of a python code //2h

22: solving p2 so that it runs fast enough no idea how //1o 1n
23: solved p1 by hand, p2 too hard //1o 1n
19: too hard, couldn't solve neither (was kinda close to the basics) //2n

sum: 35+3 stars totally on my own, 7 with hints, 6+last not solvable
-> solved 43/50 stars ##################.##++#+
favourite: origami folding (13), biggest success feeling: dijkstra (15) and polymerization (14)
